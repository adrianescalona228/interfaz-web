## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Setup

To clone this project use git or any git compatible tool.

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/adrianescalona228/interfaz-web.git"
```


This project's stack is [`flask`][flask] + `html` + `css` + `js`, to setup you must create
a virtual environment of your own, this is tested and most compatible with
the classic [`venv`][venv].

To setup this project with [`venv`][venv] run the following commands

```bash
# Create your virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Get inside your virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

When you set-up your environment you may install the packages. In this project
[`GNU make`][make] is used to ease some tasks. The following recipes are available

- **make test:** Test your current environment.
- **make run**: Run the project.
- **make install pkg=:** Install the specified package and add it to `requirements.txt`.
- **make install:** Update the project packages or install them.
- **make uninstall pkg=:** Uninstall the specified package and remove it from `requirements.txt`.
- **make docker-compose-up:** Trigger docker compose to deploy the application in the local environment.
- **make docker-compose-up build=1:** Trigger docker compose to deploy and build the application in the local environment.
- **make docker-compose-down:** Trigger docker compose to stop all the services related to this project.

You must also setup your environment file with the contents from the `.env.test` file
for the project to be able to find a database connection.

## üî® Building

You can build a deployable version using [`docker`][docker], [`docker compose`][docker-compose] is setup
in this repository so you can simply deploy your project to your machine.

There is the [`make`][make] helper which has the `docker-compose-up` and `docker-compose-down`
recipes for this purpose.

This will deploy your project in `http://localhost:5000` for you to use.
